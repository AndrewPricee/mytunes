# mytunes
A small Angular project using iTunes API.

Inspiration and design taken from TraveryMedia (https://www.traversymedia.com/)
as well as a classmate Fraser Carpenter.

Search results were limited to 3 due to it looking neat and itunes has a restriction on how many searches you can do
every minute. 3 results allows you to do multiple searches without any problems.
