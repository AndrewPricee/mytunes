#mytunes

A small Angular project using iTunes API.

Inspiration and design taken from TraveryMedia (https://www.traversymedia.com/) as well as a classmate Fraser Carpenter.

Search results were limited to 3 due to it looking neat and itunes has a restriction on how many searches you can do every minute. 3 results allows you to do multiple searches without any problems.

There was also a codePen used by a user named Ash Neilson (https://codepen.io/neilso/)

myTunes is a straight ripoff of Apple iTunes and it is very evident when looking at both pages. https://www.apple.com/za/itunes/
